        <h1>About TheraCode</h1>
        <p>
          Theracode was inspired by my dislocating my shoulder Labor Day Weekend 2023. I'm lucky to say that this was the worst injury I'd ever gotten in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is also in loving memory of my late grandfather, Michael Yaldwyn Banks, 1/17/1908 - 9/17/2023. Remeber to always love your loved ones.
